Why devops?

Earlier- to deploy an applicaton from code to customer we have 3 different roles
sys admins -> maintains servers through hypervisors like xen, vmware
server admins -> creates an application server for application so that testing engineers will test the application
build and release engineer -> deploys the code to staging/preprod/production level
developer - pushes code to cvn(centralised version control) like svn
So devops is a culture, a way of working - which improves the delivery efficiency.
