Day-9 | Git and GitHub | What is GIT ? | What is Version Control ?

Why we use git?
For easier sharing, versioning of code
sharing: In order to share our code -in organisation level its difficult to do it without a proper tracking system
Versioning: If we dont have versions of our code, its difficult to rollback to specific version of our code.
example analogy: surya(dev1) teja(dev2) is working on features calculator-a and calculator-b, both did their subsequent changes and pushed their code to git and
each given with additional features to work upon and pick the functionality from each others ealier code, 
  later after 1 week organisation decided not to go with those additional features. now git will help us in sharing and versioning easier here.
Both pushed their earlier code to the git with commit id's and now to work upon new feature they can pick the functionality from git and 
  to roll back they can use the commit id of that particular change and can go back.

Centralised vs Distributed system
Centralised - has only single central server to store and communicate with the code
Distributed - has the functionality to create the copies of our code in our local and remote machines. using fork functionality.ex: git server, github,gitlab

Git Fork vs clone?
Fork : forking repo- creating idividual copy of code to our repo
Clone : Downloading repo to our local machine

Git : install through git-scm url
git init //to initialise the git repo in local machine it'll add a .git folder where it was intialised
cd .git //tracks the changes in files thorugh objects/ folder in .git folder; has different folders/components each tracks the diff functionality;
// HEAD  config  description  hooks/  info/  objects/  refs/
git add <filename> ; git commit -m "<commitmsg>" ; git push origin <branchname> //git lifecycle
git add . //add file to staging area
git commit -m //commiting is the *versioning* of stage
git push origin // pushing the changes to repo  - if no repo is created in github and created file thorugh cli; then u can use git add remote "remoterepolink" and git remote -v
git log // shows the commit msgswith commit id
git diff //shows the difference in file currently working on
git status //to know whether our changes are in staging or not
git rest --hard commitid // to rest and go back to earlier stage
